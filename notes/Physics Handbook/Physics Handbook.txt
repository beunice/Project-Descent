Physics handbook.

Set object to child of obj_physics.

Use the Python script SI - pixels/frames converter. This physics engine works in SI units but does not convert for you, so make your conversions there.
Inside of step event:
1. Set variables.
	mass = [Mass in kg]
	dx = [direction of xforce] - Usually "rightkey - leftkey" set to 1 for right force, -1 for left force. 0 for null.
	dy = [direction of yforce] - Could be a number of things, but 1 is up, -1 is down, 0 for null.
	xforce = [x force in Newtons]
	yforce = [y force in Newtons]

2. Turn on physics + modules you want.
	physics - toggles physics.
	tsim** - toggles translation.
	fsim - toggles friction.
	rsim* - toggles rotation.
	gsim - toggles gravity.

**Available, but on by default, and currently cannot be turned off.
